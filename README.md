# Employee-Management
I have created this repository to learn Java and Microsoft SQL Server Connection and created Get Request to get Employee details

## Notes.

To communicate with Microsoft SQL Server, I have to put mssql-jdbc_auth-9.2.1 files
in Java/bin folder

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281\bin

mssql-jdbc_auth-9.2.1.x64.dll file I have put it into Employee-Management\Library
